# ClaimSys
ClaimSys is a simple web-based claims management system built with **ASP.NET Core MVC**.  
It allows users to register, log in, submit claims, and view claim history. The system also includes a dashboard with quick navigation and an overview of its functionality.

## How It Works
When the project is run, ClaimSys starts on the **Login page**.  
- New users can **register**, while existing users can **log in**.  
- After login, the user is redirected to the **Dashboard**, which shows a welcome message, overview, and quick links.  
- Users can then **submit a claim**, which is added to the in-memory claim list, and **view claim history**.  
- The **navigation bar** allows movement between Home, Claims, Reports, and Logout.

## ‚ñ∂ How to Run
1. Open the solution in **Visual Studio**.  
2. Build the project (`Ctrl+Shift+B`).  
3. Run the project (`F5` or the green play button).  
4. The system will start in the browser at the **Login page**.

## Notes
- This version stores data **in memory only** (users and claims are lost when the app restarts).  
- You can extend it by adding a **database** (e.g., SQL Server with Entity Framework).  
- Reports are currently placeholders and can be expanded with real analytics.
